                <p><b>Alphabet Inc.</b> is an American multinational conglomerate headquartered in Mountain View,
                    California. It was created through a corporate restructuring of Google on October 2, 2015, and
                    became the parent company of Google and several former Google subsidiaries. The two founders of
                    Google assumed executive roles in the new company, with <b>Larry Page</b> serving as CEO and <b>Sergey
                        Brin</b> as president.</p>
                <p>Alphabet's portfolio encompasses several industries, including technology, life sciences, investment
                    capital, and research. Some of its subsidiaries include <b>Google, Calico, Chronicle, GV, CapitalG,
                        Verily, Waymo, X, Loon and Google Fiber</b>. Some of the subsidiaries of Alphabet have altered
                    their
                    names since leaving Google and becoming part of the new parent companyâ€”Google Ventures becoming GV,
                    Google Life Sciences becoming Verily and Google X becoming just X. </p>
                <p> Following the restructuring, Page became CEO of Alphabet and Sundar Pichai took his position as CEO
                    of Google. Shares of Google's stock have been converted into Alphabet stock, which trade
                    under Google's former ticker symbols of "GOOG" and "GOOGL". As of 2018, Alphabet is ranked #22 on
                    the Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.
                    The establishment of Alphabet was prompted by a desire to make the core Google Internet services
                    business "cleaner and more accountable" while allowing greater autonomy to group companies that
                    operate in businesses other than Internet services.</p>
                <p>Alphabet's largest subsidiary is Google, other subsidiaries being Calico, Chronicle, Dandelion,
                    DeepMind, GV, CapitalG, X, Google Fiber, Jigsaw, Sidewalk Labs, Verily and Waymo. As of September
                    1, 2017, their equity are held by a subsidiary known as XXVI Holdings, Inc. (referring to the Roman
                    numeral of 26, the number of letters in the alphabet), so that they can be valued and legally
                    separated from Google. At the same time, it was announced that Google will be reorganized as a
                    limited liability company, Google LLC.</p>
